# Course-Schedule-Planner

Project allows users to plan out course schedules, given data files pertaining to pre-requisite courses, courses taken and courses planned to take in the future. 

The essence of this project allows the user to automate certain course scheduling. If a student wants a compiled list of all courses that are offered in a particular department, and each courses direct pre-reqs, they can grab this data from the project. If a student wants to determine which courses they are elligble to take, given the courses they have completed, or if they can take a certain course, they can grab this information by running the program with the correct input data.

The details and features of this project are given below:

1. Compiles a list of all courses and their direct pre reqs, given a text file containing relevant data
2. Determines if a student is able to take a desired class, given the classes they have already taken
3. Compiles a list of courses a student can taken, given a list of classes they have already taken
4. Determines which courses must be taken as pre-reqs before being able to take a quiried target course

Program utilizes stacks, queues, linkedLists and graphs to accomplish the features listed above. 

The application of this program can be extended beyond course scheduling, given relevant input text files.

Entire project was created by myself, as apart of a class project.
